# Humanoid Walking using Adversarial Imitation Learning (AMP) and PPO in Isaac Lab

This repository contains an implementation of humanoid forward walking using two learning-based approaches:

- **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** – Reinforcement Learning from scratch using task rewards  
- **Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP)** – Imitation Learning using expert motion capture data

Both methods are implemented in **NVIDIA Isaac Lab** using **Isaac Sim 4.5.0**, and utilize the `skrl` library for training and policy management. AMP integrates a discriminator trained on MoCap data to encourage realistic, human-like walking behavior.

## 🚀 How to Run

> Replace `directory_of_isaaclab` with your actual path to IsaacLab installation

### 🟦 PPO (Reinforcement Learning)

**1. Navigate to PPO project:**

```bash
cd Isaaclab_Humanoid_AMP/Isaaclab_Humanoid_PPO/source/Isaaclab_Humanoid_PPO/
```

**2. Train PPO policy:**

```bash
directory_of_isaaclab/IsaacLab/isaaclab.sh -p scripts/skrl/train.py --task Isaaclab-Humanoid-Ppo-v0
```

**3. Run trained policy:**

```bash
directory_of_isaaclab/IsaacLab/isaaclab.sh -p scripts/skrl/play.py --task Isaaclab-Humanoid-Ppo-v0
```

---

### 🟩 AMP (Adversarial Imitation Learning)

**1. Navigate to AMP project:**

```bash
cd Isaaclab_Humanoid_AMP/Isaaclab_Humanoid_AMP/source/Isaaclab_Humanoid_AMP/
```

**2. Train AMP policy:**

```bash
directory_of_isaaclab/IsaacLab/isaaclab.sh -p scripts/skrl/train.py --task Isaaclab-Humanoid-Ppo-v0 --algorithm AMP
```

**3. Run trained AMP policy:**

```bash
directory_of_isaaclab/IsaacLab/isaaclab.sh -p scripts/skrl/play.py --task Isaaclab-Humanoid-Ppo-v0 --algorithm AMP
```
